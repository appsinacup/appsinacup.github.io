In this update I added many improvements to hopefuly bring [Godot Box2D](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2007) to parity with Godot Physics 2D, which is the Godot default Physics Engine for 2D.

You can read more about the v0.8 release [here](https://github.com/appsinacup/godot-box2d/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

## Adding Angle Limit and Motor to PinJoint2D

One change I am really happy about is making the Godot PinJoint2D API follow more closely the Box2D Revolute Joint API.

Up until now, the PinJoint2D didn't have angle limits or motor. So I decided to change that with [PR#81610](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81610). (The implementation is based of Chipmunk physics engine).

Then, I also added it to the Godot Extension that replaces the default 2D Physics Engine. Pfew.

Here it is with Godot Physics 2D:

And here it is with Godot Box2D:

## Other Fixes

- SegmentShape2D crash
- ShapeCast not working
- CharacterBody2D margin, collision detection and conveyer belt for static bodies.
