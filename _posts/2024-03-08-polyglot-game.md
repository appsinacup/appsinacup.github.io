Polyglot (person who knows several languages) is a mobile and web language learning game about a pirate who wants to master all the languages. Match words to have the player move or attack in the game. The game also supports multiplayer co-op mode.

## Select Language

Pick a language you know and one you want to learn. All the words are taken from [wiktionary.org](https://en.wiktionary.org) and processed using [kaikki.org](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/) version.

## Select Learner

Learning is a personal thing, so you have to trust your polyglot pirate. Pick one you relate with:
- Captain: The organized learner. Learns until he masters a language.
- Clowny: The crazy learner, starts multiple languages at once.
- Baldy: The learner who likes to talk even if he doesn't know. Learns by practice.
- Brute: Spends time to memorize words before even trying to speak.

All the assets used are made by [PixelFrog](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io).
