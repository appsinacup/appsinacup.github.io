I am working on a new open source game server with **authentication, users, lobbies, server scripting and admin portal**, built with **Elixir**. Links:

- [Guides](https://gamend.appsinacup.com/docs/setup)


# Competition

This is how it compares with what exists today:

|Solution|Language|Auth|Persistence|Friends|Scaling|Cost after ~5k CCU|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Gamend**|Elixir|Yes|SQLite / PostgreSQL|Yes|Horizontal (BEAM clustering)|$0|
|**Nakama**|Go|Yes|PostgreSQL|Yes|Manual sharding or paid cloud|$1k+/mo (cloud)|
|**Colyseus**|TypeScript|Beta|No|No|Node clustering|$0|

- Note 1: Since **Gamend** works with SQLite also, hosting a single instance costs just 5$.
- Note 2: **Nakama** costs after scaling because it either requires manual configuration (hard to setup, not trivial) or enterprise version. **Colyseus** and **Gamend** both scale normally, without any enterprise edition.
