1. Open the AssetLib tab.
2. Search for Rapier 2D and click on the plugin.
3. Click Download and then Install.
4. Restart when prompted.

To enable the plugin:

1. Go to Project -> Project Settings -> General tab.
2. Go to Physics -> 2D. Enable Advance Settings.
3. At Physics Engine select Rapier2D.
4. Restart when prompted.

## Notes

It should be noted that Rapier does not have warm starting capabilities. This means that in specific configurations, such as a stack of boxes or a pyramid of boxes, its stability will be less than that of Box2D. 

That's why, by default, the number of iterations in Rapier is set relatively high. This comes with a performance cost, but it still remains at the forefront in terms of performance. This higher iteration count helps to mitigate the aforementioned stability issue. Hopefully, this feature will be implemented in rapier in the future.
