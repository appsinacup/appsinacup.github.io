# Introduction of each framework

## Godot Physics 2D

The Godot Engine is a free, all-in-one, cross-platform game engine that makes it easy for you to create 2D and 3D games. So it's no surprise it also has a physics engine that works great for most use cases.

Rapier is set of 2D and 3D physics engines focused on performance. They are written with the Rust programming language, by the [Dimforge](https://dimforge.com) organization. It is forever free and open-source! It is a relatively new contender, with only about 3 years since it was created.

Box2D is a free 2D open source physics engine for games and published under MIT license. It is written by [Erin Catto](https://box2d.org) and is one of the oldest (more than 15 years) and most stable 2d physics library out there.
