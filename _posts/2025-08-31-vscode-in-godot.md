## Overview

This is a proof of concept of embedding the VSCode text editor in the Godot Engine.

Features:
- Authenticate
- Edit Code
- Change Color themes
- Plugins
- Copilot
- etc.

Basically everything the regular editor would.

## Notes

- This is still work in progress, but will update this page next week sometime when I will have a public build working. Right now I have it working locally.
