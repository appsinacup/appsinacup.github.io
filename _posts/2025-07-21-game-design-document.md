The following is AppsInACup`s proposal for a wholesome social massively multiplayer world with minigames, playable on Web, Desktop and Mobile (Discord, Steam, Itch). Minigame Park is a watercolor themed world where you walk and play minigames (chess, word match, hangman, etc.) with focus on customization and socializing.

## Overview

Minigame Park is an online world where the player selects a character and customizes it, gets tickets and goes to rides, which are minigames he can play with other people while leaving behind highscores and getting prizes. The world is isometric, with squares for moving spaces. The movement is from cell to cell, with mouse or keyboard. The character can play minigames by entering an attraction/ride with tickets and joining a game with other people.

The player will be able to customize his character, clothes and special items. As he plays more, he will also gain special items by either winning a lot of times or winning against a number of players or gaining a specific score in a game. This will also unlock special modes of games.

There will be different regions. There will be:
- amusement parks with different attractions (eg. classical park, with classical games, eg. tictactoe, chess, hangman)
- TODO

The heart of the game are the minigames. In each minigame players select an avatar and when players are ready the game starts. Each game has 3 rounds, each round players earned points doubling. Each minigame will have an animated background and reuse most of the elements from other minigames (eg. buttons, fonts, icons).

Minigame e.g.:

The game will be massively multiplayer online with up to 100 players visible on screen at the same time (and the full map having even more). The game will be split into multiple regions, but this will not be obvious to the player, as the transitions from one zone to another is done automatically as he walks. Players will also be able to do both public and private games.

## Plot and Setting

The game is set in an amusement park world.
- could be a series of different themes

## Gameplay


## Marketing

The game will be marketed on twitter / discord / reddit / youtube. It will launch as early access and free on steam, and people will be able to try games on discord also and give feedback as they play. The idea is to integrate it with streamers as to make it big.

## Development

The initial game should be done in 3-6 months, and additional minigames can be added after.
